# Worksheet 2

Worksheet 2 covers all material from [Module 2: Media](https://jentery.github.io/mdia200v6/#module-2-media-six-sessions). Your response is due via Brightspace by Monday, February 23rd at 10am. 

The worksheet is *open-book*, meaning you are allowed to use handouts, the course website, my slides, your notes, recordings of class sessions, the library, and the internet to address the prompts.

*Please cite your source material, including any media you discuss in your responses.*

## Download the Worksheet 

You should [download the worksheet](mdia200v6Worksheet2.docx) (DOCX format) and complete it in a word processor such as Microsoft Word, Google Docs, OpenOffice, LibreOffice, or Pages for Mac.  

Note that this webpage contains information (including information about how we'll assess your responses) that does *not* appear in the downloadable worksheet. We thus recommend reading this entire page before you start the assignment. 

## Format

This open-book worksheet contains *five* prompts. You should respond to *four* of them. If you respond to all five, then we will mark the first four. 

Each response is worth 25 points for a total of 100 points. 

Some prompts ask you to create media. Please attach your audio, image, or video files to your response in Brightspace. Do *not* use YouTube, SoundCloud, Vimeo, Google Drive, or any other non-Brightspace platform to submit files. 

## The Five Prompts (Select Four)

**Prompt 1**. Use terminology from the ["Understanding Media,"](https://bright.uvic.ca/d2l/le/lessons/431416/topics/3694718) ["Images,"](https://bright.uvic.ca/d2l/le/lessons/431416/topics/3694723) and ["Comics"](https://bright.uvic.ca/d2l/le/lessons/431416/topics/3694722) handouts to annotate one page or spread of a comic of your choice. Fill the margins and gutters of the comic with descriptions of what you see. Then use no more than 425 words to 1) say why you selected the comic, 2) explain how you organized the annotations, 3) share some critical decisions you made while writing those annotations, and 4) tell us what you learned about the medium of images from this exercise. You're welcome to use software to annotate the page or spread, or you can print it and annotate it manually. Don't forget to attach the annotations to your submission as an image file.

We recommend consulting [these examples](https://bright.uvic.ca/d2l/le/lessons/431416/topics/3694703) of how to annotate a comic. Note how most of them are colour-coded, include a legend, and place the comic on a larger canvas or piece of paper for the sake of annotation.

If you're new to comics and don't know where to begin, then you're welcome to annotate a page or spread of Adrian Tomine's ["Translated, From the Japanese"](https://bright.uvic.ca/d2l/le/lessons/431416/topics/3694702) for this exercise. 

**Prompt 2**. Identify some signage on campus or somewhere in Greater Victoria that uses text in a memorable way. Photograph the sign and attach that photo to your submission. Now imagine a typographical alteration you could make to that sign that would subtly adjust or refine its style and material connotation without dramatically altering its verbal and functional communication. (You should thus avoid any typographical modifications, such as Wingdings, that would change the sign's language.) Next, use your preferred software to 1) transcribe the sign's text (all of its alphanumeric characters), 2) change its typeface and font, 3) export your new version of the sign as an image or text file, and 4) attach that file to your submission. For your final step, use no more than 425 words, including terminology from the ["Understanding Media"](https://bright.uvic.ca/d2l/le/lessons/431416/topics/3694718) and ["Text"](https://bright.uvic.ca/d2l/le/lessons/431416/topics/3694725) handouts, to tell us 1) which new typeface you selected for the sign, 2) why you selected that typeface to replace the original one, 3) how the features of your new typeface subtly adjust or refine the sign's style and material connotation, 4) how those features avoid introducing any dramatic alterations to the sign's verbal and functional communication, and 5) what you learned about the medium of text from this exercise. Don't forget to include 1) a photograph of the original sign and 2) your modified version of it in your response. 

I recommend consulting [Typewolf](https://www.typewolf.com/recommendations), [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), or even [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_typefaces) to learn more about typefaces during this exercise. 

**Prompt 3**. Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFVLWo5B81w) about Joanna Fang's Foley work for Sony. Then record a short video (no longer than a minute) of a scene from your everyday life. (It doesn't have to include any people in it.) Now create and record two Foley sounds that could play at some point during your short video. Two rules: 1) you cannot use your mouth to make the sounds, and 2) you cannot produce footsteps Foley. Next, use no more than 425 words, including terminology from the ["Understanding Media"](https://bright.uvic.ca/d2l/le/lessons/431416/topics/3694718) and ["Audio"](https://bright.uvic.ca/d2l/le/lessons/431416/topics/3694727) handouts, to 1) describe your two Foley sounds, 2) explain how you made them, 3) provide timestamps for when they would play in your short video, and 4) tell us what you learned about the medium of audio from this exercise. Don't forget to attach your two audio files and your video file to your submission.

You are welcome to edit your short video to include your Foley sounds (rather than using timestamps and attaching the audio separately), but video editing is not an expectation of this prompt and will not shape our assessment of your response.   

**Prompt 4**. Watch [*Biidaaban*](https://www.spottedfawnproductions.com/biidaaban/) a few times and take notes as you do. Now, review your notes and identify three different types of camera shots in the video. Then use no more than 425 words, including terminology from the ["Understanding Media"](https://bright.uvic.ca/d2l/le/lessons/431416/topics/3694718) and ["Video"](https://bright.uvic.ca/d2l/le/lessons/431416/topics/3694730) handouts, to 1) include still images documenting each of the three camera shots you identified, 2) provide the following information for each camera shot: a) timestamp, b) shot type, c) brief shot description (the action and the shot's content), and d) why you selected it, and 3) tell us what you learned about *Biidaaban* and the medium of video from this exercise. Don't forget to attach three image files (one per type of camera shot) to your submission. 

**Prompt 5**. Take a photo of a scene from your everyday life and then use whichever technique you prefer to draw a [heads-up display (HUD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HUD_(video_games)) over it. You are welcome to stage the photograph as if it's a scene in a game and add images and other assets to it during the editing process. Then use no more than 425 words, including terminology from the ["Understanding Media"](https://bright.uvic.ca/d2l/le/lessons/431416/topics/3694718) and ["Interfaces"](https://bright.uvic.ca/d2l/le/lessons/431416/topics/3694756) handouts, to 1) describe your HUD, 2) explain how you made it, 3) identify its [video game genre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_genres), and 4) tell us what you learned about the medium of interfaces from this exercise. You are welcome to use software (electronic, digital means) or paper (print, analog means) to make your HUD. Don't forget to attach your image file to your submission.

We recommend consulting the [Game UI Database](https://www.gameuidatabase.com/index.php) or [Interface in Game](https://interfaceingame.com/) for ideas during this exercise. 

## Assessment 

We will use the following criteria to guide our assessment of your responses. 

The degree to which they: 

* Address each aspect of the prompt.
* Persuasively combine writing with media (including images, audio, text, and video). 
* Engage and even enhance the course material.
* Are supported by a convincing use of detail and examples.  
* Apply terminology and concepts from class discussions, course handouts, lectures, and slides. 
* Integrate media theory with media practice. 
* Communicate what you're learning from the prompted exercises. 
* Communicate synthetically and make connections across the course material. 

We will use the following rubric, based on [UVic's official grading system](https://www.uvic.ca/calendar/future/undergrad/index.php#/policy/S1AAgoGuV?bc=true&bcCurrent=14%20-%20Grading&bcGroup=Undergraduate%20Academic%20Regulations&bcItemType=policies), to assess your responses. 

* 22.5-25 points ("normally achieved by a minority of students;" exceeds all or most expectations of the prompt): the response is compelling; it addresses the prompt and applies course terminology; it enhances the course material, including class discussions, course handouts, lectures, and slides; the use of examples is clear, focused, convincing, and inventive (original insight)
* 19.5-22 points ("normally achieved by a minority of students" or "represents a more complex understanding and/or application of the course material;" exceeds most or some expectations of the prompt): the response is compelling; it addresses the prompt and applies course terminology; it corresponds with the course material, including class discussions, course handouts, lectures, and slides; the use of examples is clear, focused, and convincing 
* 17.5-19 points (meets or mostly meets the expectations of the prompt): the response addresses the prompt and applies course terminology; it corresponds with the course material, including class discussions, course handouts, lectures, and slides; the use of examples is often convincing but may warrant some clarification
* 15-17 points (meets some expectations of the prompt): the response addresses some of the prompt and applies some course terminology; it corresponds with some of the course material, including class discussions, course handouts, lectures, and slides; the use of examples warrants some clarification
* 1-14.5 points (does not meet the expectations of the prompt): the response does not correspond much, if at all, with the course material or the prompt
* 0 points: no response  

The total of these points (0-100) will constitute 20% of your final mark in this course. 

12 points will be deducted from the overall mark if no references are included at the end of the worksheet (see "Citing Your Sources").

8 points will be deducted from the overall mark if the references at the end of the worksheet are not formatted according to an established citation style (see "Citing Your Sources").

5 points will be deducted for every source that's used in a response but is not included in the references section at the end of the worksheet (see "Citing Your Sources").

5 points will be deducted for every fabricated source used in the worksheet (see "Citing Your Sources").

We encourage you to cite the course handouts but do not expect you to do so unless you quote or paraphrase them. See "Cite this Handout" at the end of every handout. 

1 point will be deducted for every 25 words over the prescribed word count. 

*You do not need to meet the word count in each response to earn a high mark.* 

We recommend using prose (paragraphs) rather than point form in your responses. Prose is more synthetic and will allow you to make connections.

We also recommend writing your responses from the first-person perspective. That point of view makes it easier for you to explain your decisions and share what you learned from each exercise. 

You should avoid repetition within responses and across them. We do not recommend writing about the same topic or theme in every response (e.g., four responses about video games, TikTok, or a particular fandom).

## AI Tools 

We do not recommend relying on generative AI or other AI tools to respond to this assignment. AI-generated responses tend to be generic, and they lack self-reflection, which is a key element of every prompt in this worksheet. AI results can also be biased and incorrect. It is your responsibility to ensure that the information you use from AI is accurate. You should also pay attention to the privacy of your data. Many AI tools will incorporate and use any content (including copyrighted materials, original work, and personal information) you upload, paste, or share with them. In short, relying on AI could create more work for you in the end, and it tends to hinder or “deskill” the learning process.

All sources, including AI tools, must be properly cited. (Language for this policy was drawn from language used at the [University of Washington](https://teaching.washington.edu/course-design/ai/sample-ai-syllabus-statements/).) 

## Citing Your Sources 

Please do not forget to cite any material from which you draw ideas or examples. This includes course handouts but also any AI tools if you decide to use them. You are welcome to use your preferred citation style (MLA, Chicago, or APA, e.g.). 

## What to Submit 

Please submit a DOCX, ODT, PAGES, or PDF file containing your answers and references along with any media files you were prompted to attach or embed. 

## When to Submit It

A response to Worksheet 2 is due by 10am on Monday, February 23rd, but there is a 24-hour grace period. We will deduct five points for every business day we receive Worksheet 2 after 10am on Tuesday, February 24th. We will close the submission portal for Worksheet 2 at 10am on Monday, March 9th, and cannot accept any submissions after the portal is closed.
